# Welcome to RAQA Chatbot! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

Hi there, User! ðŸ‘‹ This Chatbot is useful to answer questions from a PDF or text file. 
It is a very simple implementation of using `aimakerspace` library, `langchain` and `chainlit`

**Note:**
    - The PDF loading takes time. The chatbot uses `gpt-3.5-turbo`
    - For sample pdfs you can get [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06825.pdf)
